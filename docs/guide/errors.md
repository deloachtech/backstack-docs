# Errors

The API returns an error object with each unsuccessful request. 

Backstack uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the failure of a request. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate a
request failed (i.e. a required parameter was omitted). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate a system error.


## Error object {#error-object}

```json
{
  "error": {
    "request_method": "post",
    "type": "user",
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Required values are missing.",
    "fields": {
      "username": "This value is required.",
      "password": "This value is required."
    },
    "dev_message": "Unknown resource."
  }
}
```


::: info
The `error.message` is always suitable for user feedback. When the error type is `user`, details are provided to assist
the user in recovery. Otherwise, the default "An error occurred. Please try again later." is provided.

## Error types

You can also evaluate the error by checking the `error.type`. All errors are categorized by one of the following types.

| Type       | Description                                                                                                                     |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `user`     | An error occurred as a result of user provided values (e.g. invalid password, required data missing).                           |
| `codebase` | The request was invalid or missing required parameters that could not be provided by the user (e.g. uri, api keys, record IDs). |
| `system`   | System errors indicate there was a problem on our end.                                                                          |

|-------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `400` | Bad Request       | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. |

| `404` | Not Found         | The requested resource doesn't exist.                                    |
| `429` | Too Many Requests | Too many requests hit the API too quickly.                               |
| `500` | Server Errors     | Something went wrong on our end.                                         |
